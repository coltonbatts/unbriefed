## Overview

**UNBRIEFED** is a frontend architectural experiment operating at the intersection of high-end design, WebGL physics, and modern web frameworks. It runs as the central nervous system for a 90-day creative sprint, tracking daily spec ad campaigns produced by Colton Batts for 90 of the world's leading brands.

Built to break away from standard flat web interfaces, this project features:

- **Custom-Engineered 3D Physics:** A bespoke `requestAnimationFrame` lerping loop driving ultra-smooth, lightweight 3D hover interactions.
- **Performant WebGL Landscapes:** A dynamic Three.js particle and geometric background that reacts in real-time to scroll and cursor movement without choking mobile browsers.
- **Glassmorphic UI Systems:** Premium CSS masking, dynamic variable gradients, and complex layered blending that feels tactile and alive.
- **Modern Next.js Stack:** Fully optimized, strongly typed (TypeScript), and globally deployed on the Edge via Vercel.

## The Developer

**I am currently looking for my next role.**

If you are looking for a creative developer, designer, or technical director who can bridge the gap between heavy engineering and relentless aesthetic execution—let's talk.

- **Design:** Figma, Framer, Motion Graphics, Premium UI/UX
- **Engineering:** React, Next.js, Three.js, TypeScript, WebGL
